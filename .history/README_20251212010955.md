## Additional Projects

### [Cloud computing](https://github.com/younganswer/Cloud-computing)

-   Demonstrated a fully-managed microservice architecture using AWS ECS Fargate, achieving scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency through containerization and serverless deployment.
-   Integrated AWS services such as Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution and CloudWatch for centralized monitoring, with automated scaling via ECS Service Auto Scaling to ensure high availability and optimal resource utilization.
-   Streamlined operations by eliminating EC2 management, providing a robust foundation for modern cloud-native applications.

### [FileProcessing Report Tester](https://github.com/KMU-File-Processing/File-Processing-Report-Tester)

-   An automated testing tool for evaluating student reports in the FileProcessing course
-   Developed using C++ for core functionalities, shell scripting for automation, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD integration
-   Addressed student concerns around vague assignment instructions and unclear evaluation criteria by rewriting task documentation and implementing an automated grading system using GitHub Actions CI

### [B-Tree](https://github.com/younganswer/B-Tree)

-   B-Tree source code originally used in the FileProcessing Report Tester project.
-   Provides a C++ implementation of the B-Tree data structure, supporting insertion, deletion, and search operations.
-   Designed similar to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), with iterator support but without allocators and deallocators.

### [@42Cursus](https://github.com/younganswer/42cursus)

-   [ft_transcendence](https://github.com/Last-transcendence/ft_transcendence)
    -   A full-stack web application, featuring real-time multiplayer gaming and social networking functionalities.

-   [miniRT](https://github.com/Younganswer/miniRT)
    -   A simple ray tracing program with miniLibX that generates 3D scenes from a scene description file.
    -   Implemented core ray tracing algorithms including sphere and plane intersection, lighting models (ambient, diffuse, specular), shadows, and reflections.
-   [cub3D](https://github.com/younganswer/cub3d)
    -   A simple ray casting game inspired by Wolfenstein 3D using miniLibX.
    -   Implemented a 2D ray casting algorithm for rendering a 3D environment from a 2D map.

    -   A simple Unix shell implementation in C inspired by bash.
    -   Supports built-in commands, environment variable management, input/output redirection, and piping.
